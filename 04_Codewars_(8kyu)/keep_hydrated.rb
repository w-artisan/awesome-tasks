# Keep Hydrated!

# Nathan loves cycling.

# Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated,
# he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

# You get given the time in hours and you need to return
# the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

# For example:

# time = 3 ----> litres = 1
# time = 6.7---> litres = 3
# time = 11.8--> litres = 5

def litres(time)
  (time / 2.0).floor
end

# Sample Tests:
# Test.describe("Basic tests") do
# Test.assert_equals(litres(2), 1)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(1), 0)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(10), 5)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(1.4), 0)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(12.3), 6)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(0.82), 0)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(11.8), 5)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(1787), 893)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(0), 0)
# Test.assert_equals(litres(5.5), 2)
# end
