# A Needle in the Haystack
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/56676e8fabd2d1ff3000000c/ruby

# Can you find the needle in the haystack?
# Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"
# After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:
# "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:
# find_needle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
# should return "found the needle at position 5"

def find_needle(haystack)
  n = haystack.index('needle')
  "found the needle at position #{n}"
end

# Sample Tests:
# Test.describe("Basic tests") do
# Test.assert_equals(find_needle(['3', '123124234', nil, 'needle', 'world', 'hay', 2, '3', true, false]), 'found the needle at position 3')
# Test.assert_equals(find_needle(['283497238987234', 'a dog', 'a cat', 'some random junk', 'a piece of hay', 'needle', 'something somebody lost a while ago']), 'found the needle at position 5')
# Test.assert_equals(find_needle([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,7,5,4,3,4,5,6,67,5,5,3,3,4,2,34,234,23,4,234,324,324,'needle',1,2,3,4,5,5,6,5,4,32,3,45,54]), 'found the needle at position 30')
# Test.assert_equals(find_needle(['needle',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,7,5,4,3,4,5,6,67,5,5,3,3,4,2,34,234,23,4,234,324,324,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,5,4,32,3,45,54]), 'found the needle at position 0')
# Test.assert_equals(find_needle([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,7,5,4,3,4,5,6,67,5,5,3,3,4,2,34,234,23,4,234,324,324,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,5,4,32,3,45,54,'needle']), 'found the needle at position 43')
